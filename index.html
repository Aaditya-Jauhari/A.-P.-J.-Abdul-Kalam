                    <h2>Missile man of India</h2>
                    <p>➼ Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, full name Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was an eminent Indian scientist and
                        politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in
                        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background and rose to prominence through his contributions to
                        the field of aerospace <br><br>
                        ➼ Kalam played a key role in India's civilian space program and military missile development. He was often
                        referred to as the "People's President" due to his approachable and inspirational demeanor. Before his
                        presidency, he held various positions in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence
                        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                        ➼ Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was a highly respected figure known for his vision, integrity,
                        and commitment to education. Even after his term as President, he continued to inspire students and the youth
                        through his speeches and writings, promoting education, innovation, and values. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed
                        away on July 27, 2015, but his legacy continues to inspire generations in India and beyond.<br><br>
              
                        ➼ Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a Tamil Muslim family, and his early life was marked by financial struggles.
                        Despite these challenges, he excelled in academics and graduated in aeronautical engineering from the Madras
                        Institute of Technology. Kalam played a crucial role in India's space exploration and military missile
                        development, particularly in the development of ballistic missile technology.<br><br>
                        He was intimately involved in India's first satellite launch vehicle and the development of the indigenous
                        satellite launch vehicle (SLV). His leadership in the successful testing of the Agni and Prithvi missiles
                        solidified his reputation as a key figure in India's defense and space capabilities.<br><br>
                        ➼ Apart from his contributions to science and technology, Dr. Kalam was a passionate advocate for education. He
                        believed that education was the key to a nation's progress and development. Even during his presidency, he
                        continued to connect with students and young people, emphasizing the importance of learning, innovation, and
                        creativity.<br><br>
                        ➼ Dr. Kalam authored several books, including "Wings of Fire" and "Ignited Minds," where he shared his life
                        experiences and vision for a developed India. His engaging and motivational speeches, often directed at
                        students, earned him the nickname "People's President."<br>
                        ➼ After his term as President, Kalam remained an active public figure, participating in various educational and
                        societal initiatives. His sudden demise while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management
                        Shillong in 2015 was a profound loss for India. However, his teachings and legacy endure, continuing to
                        inspire individuals to pursue knowledge, innovation, and a sense of responsibility towards society.</p>
